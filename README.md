# unison-json
JSON ast / parser / printer for unison

## Development

For now you can just start unison in it's project folder with `./scripts/unisonloop.sh` and create a symlink from `src/json.u` inside the `unison-src` folder.

no you can't because of https://github.com/haskell-fswatch/hfsnotify/issues/87
